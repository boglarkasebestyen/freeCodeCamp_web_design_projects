freeCodeCamp is a donor-supported tax-exempt 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. Their mission is to help people learn to code for free by creating thousands of videos, articles, and interactive coding lessons - all freely available to the public. They also have thousands of freeCodeCamp study groups around the world.

## About 

This repository includes my 5 final projects from 2019 that conclude freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course. The projects are:

1. Tribute Page
2. Survey Form
3. Product Landing Page
4. Technical Documentation Page
5. Personal Portfolio Page

The objective for all 5 static websites was to fulfill FCC's user stories and to build them via [CodePen](https://codepen.io/trending).

## Disclaimer
The recommended technologies to build these projects were plain HTML / CSS. If the student had prior knowledge of Vanilla JavaScript, Bootstrap (CSS framework) or SASS (CSS preprocessor), it was allowed to use these technologies, as well. 

However, additional, more advanced technologies, for example jQuery, React, Angular or Vue were not recommended for these tasks.

### Tribute Page
I dedicated this page to Lil' Sebastian, one of the main key characters taken from the American NBC sitcom/mockumentary "Parks and Recreation". View the page in CodePen [here](https://codepen.io/boglarkasebestyen/full/oVVrMX).

### Survey Form
An edgy, monochrome survey page that asks the user which is their favorite guitar brand. View the page in CodePen [here](https://codepen.io/boglarkasebestyen/full/axvmyB).

### Product Landing Page
This became a page dedicated to a Canadian-American animated television comedy series created by Danny Antonucci for Cartoon Network, namely "Ed Edd N' Eddy". With nearly an 11-year run, it was the longest-running Cartoon Network original series, entirely hand-drawn throughout its course.

The aim of the page is to act as a merchandise website / subscription box service, similar to [Loot Crate](https://lootcrate.com), as well as a means to urge the user to read more about the cartoon and to join the fanbase. 

Usability: the user gets to choose between 3 types of subscriptions, and receives exclusive Ed Edd N' Eddy merch.

### Technical Documentation Page
This page tries to look like a documentation page for a graphics editing program I've been using for years, namely PhotoScape. PhotoScape is developed by MOOII Tech, Korea. View the page in CodePen [here](https://codepen.io/boglarkasebestyen/full/yrpWEd).

### Personal Portfolio Page
I chose to present the fictional "Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog" in this portfolio page to give it a twist and comic relief. The character is taken from the iconic 1975 movie "Monty Python and the Holy Grail". View the page in CodePen [here](https://codepen.io/boglarkasebestyen/full/pBqeMQ).
